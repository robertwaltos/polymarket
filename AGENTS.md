# Local Agent Instructions

- For any command intended for the user to run, provide it in a fenced `powershell` code block so it is copy/paste-ready.
- Prefer one command per code block unless commands must be run as a sequence.
- Keep commands complete and executable as-written (no placeholders unless explicitly labeled).
- If a step requires multiple commands, number the steps and include one copy/paste block per step.
- For continuity on roadmap execution, treat `docs/ABC_PHASE_IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md` as the required progress ledger for Phase A/B/C work.
- After each completed implementation milestone affecting Phase A/B/C, update `docs/ABC_PHASE_IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md` in the same change set (status + progress log entry).
