# Local Agent Instructions

- For any command intended for the user to run, provide it in a fenced `powershell` code block so it is copy/paste-ready.
- Prefer one command per code block unless commands must be run as a sequence.
- Keep commands complete and executable as-written (no placeholders unless explicitly labeled).
- If a step requires multiple commands, number the steps and include one copy/paste block per step.
